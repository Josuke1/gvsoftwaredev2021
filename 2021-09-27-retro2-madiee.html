        <section>
            <p>The article I chose to read was "Presenting to Execs". What I was more interested in was advice on presenting to a group of people and how to build my confidence in presenting. The most interesting portion of the article I read was "Mistakes to Avoid" because it made me aware of some of the mistakes I made and how I can correct them to make a more successful presentation in my classes</p>
