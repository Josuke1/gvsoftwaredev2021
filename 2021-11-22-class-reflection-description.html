	<h4>Assignment Description:</h4>

<p>The class was assigned 4 separate topics for the week of 10/25/21 which was led by JacobT and David.</p>
<p> The 4 topics included:</p>
	<ul>
		
		<li> Class/goal reflections</li>
		
		<li>Software development topics</li>
		
		<li>Software development methodologies</li>
		
		<li>David sharing his work experience</li>
		
		
	</ul>
<p>At the beginning of the year each student had to write down their class goals and this first topic is reflecting on those goals now that we are almost done with the semester, and it also included a reflection of the class as a whole. For example, what would you do differently if you were to lead the class, what do you think is going well, etc.</p>

<p>Each student was given a different type of <a href="https://vocal.media/01/10-different-types-of-software-development">software development</a> such as data science or web development and had to find articles to read and write about based on the topic they were given for the second topic. They could write things down they knew already, didnâ€™t know, found interesting, etc.</p>

<p>For the third topic, each person was given a type of software development methodology which is basically the work method that different people/companies use such as <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/kanban-vs-scrum">Kanban and Scrum</a>, or <a href="https://project-management.com/agile-vs-waterfall/"> Agile and Waterfall</a>. They were to reflect on this just like topic #2 and this is important because we are using some of those methodologies in this class</p>

<p>For the final topic, David shared his work experience with the class and showed his screen and what he typically does everyday as someone who actually works in the software development field. Students wrote down questions they had for him or things they found interesting and asked him those questions</p>
