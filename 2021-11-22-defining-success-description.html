			<h4> Assignment Description: </h4>

			<p>The defining success assignment is an assignment that helped students 
			taking a Software development course to think  about what success might look like for them in this class. The main purpose of 
			this assignment was to give people in this course a goal that they want to achieve at the end of this course. At the end of the semester, we can look back and see if we still have the same the goal as when the class started, or if we achieved it.</p>
