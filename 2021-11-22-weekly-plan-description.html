			<h4> Assignment Description: </h4>

			<p>The weekly plan assignment is giving each student team an opportunity to lead a class discussion and assignment for a week. With several outstanding tasks for developing our class website, student teams brainstormed what to work on each week and how to format that into a formal class session. Students determined how each class session would be broken down, the potential distribution of work, and how to get the final product included on the website. During their scheduled week, students effectively drove the class discussion and communicated/problem-solved with other students for the completion of assignments. </p>
