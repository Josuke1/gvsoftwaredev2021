			<h4> Assignment Description: </h4>

			<p>Students received a topic given in class pertaining to software development. This was a group assignment where each group was given a different topic to better understand the HTML language. They then wrote a post on their topic using paragraphs, lists, pictures, videos, and anything else that was necessary to teach the rest of the class about a specific HTML element. This assignment was to let students get familiar with the development steps of a web page. Students were divided into groups and assigned a different task of the whole work. These posts are a great reference point to be used throughout the semester when completing other assignments!</p>
