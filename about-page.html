        <h4> About Grand View Software Development: </h4>
        <p> Grand Viewâ€™s Software Development course is a hands-on experience. During class, tasks are assigned to individuals or groups to be completed by the end of the week. These tasks introduced students to new topics or processes that would be needed to build the class website. Through doing the assigned tasks for building the class site, students were able to gain a better understanding of the software development cycle and ultimately, become better programmers.</p>
