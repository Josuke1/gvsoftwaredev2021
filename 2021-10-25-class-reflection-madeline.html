           <h4>Class Reflection</h4> 
        
            <p>My original goals were to build my communication skills and use what I’ve learned in my future endeavors. Reflecting on that now I feel I did improve my communication skills by working on group projects. Also, by presenting to the group I have built my communication skills. </p>
        
            <p>I feel like I learned a lot about Git and GitHub which could come in handy when I do internships or start working. It seems like a lot of companies work in group projects so having a tool like Git to allow groups to add their own contributions is very helpful.</p>

            <p>An improvement this class could have been to teach Git and Pull Requests earlier in the semester. Also, assignments could be given in the beginning of the week and be due at the end of the week or next week.</p>

            <h4>Web Development</h4>

            <p>I am interested in Web Development, so I agree with the statement about the amount of coding that is done for the sites. You don’t realize how much content you are putting out and reflecting on it, my own website is about 50 pages which is crazy to think about. There are types of Web Development: front-end which is what we’ve been doing for class and back-end like JavaScript and php. </p>

            <h4>Kanban</h4>

            <p>Kanban is a free flow working process for groups that allows them to creatively think about the process. You can customize the workflow columns to better fit your project. There are also no set deadlines, you release updates as you go, which is interesting because it reminds me of video game patch updates. </p>

            <h4>Thoughts on David's work</h4>

            <p>It was interesting to hear what David does as a Cobalt programmer. I've not heard much about it, so it was cool to get a detailed explanation of the programming language and how it works. It was also interesting to see the form composition program and how it can fill in data depending on what they need. </p>

            <p>Hearing how groups are also changed around based on the projects was interesting to hear about. It really encourages people to be flexible to how others work. The point system seems like a nice incentive I wonder if there are rewards for people with higher points</p>
