<h1> Imagine repeating the past month of software development for 8hrs/day

and 5days/wk and 50 weeks/year for the next year. </h1>

<h4> Retro Assignment #1   </h4> 
<h4> How I feel the past month of software development:  </h4> 

 <ul>
<li> Primary </li>
</ul>

<p> I want to be able to write and creative of what I do, I feel like I'm interesting in the work I did and felt like the coolest impactful thing for me </p>
 
<ul>
<li> Requires a skill </li>
</ul>

 <p>I have to learn and build step by step by doing the work and learn from the really basic thing to be able to work </p>

<ul>
<li> Do Research  </li>
</ul>


<p> Learn the code from other people like youtube , think about what is the next step, why is the code not working properly.  </p>
 <ul>
<li> Ask my self what I can learn </li>
</ul>
<p> for example: Rather than considering a to be as a weight overloading, I view at it as a venturing stone toward my objectives. </p>

<ul>
<li> Make a plan moving forward when I'm stuck </li>
</ul>

<p> Contemplate what I will do another way sometime later. Make an arrangement that will assist with incorprating the data I need to acquired. </p>
